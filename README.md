# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Using-MRI-Images
Brain tumors consist of a varied range of abnormal cell proliferation occurring within the 
brain, presenting potential life-threatening implications. They are categorized as originating 
within the brain or nearby tissues or resulting from the spreading of cancerous cells from other 
body parts. The precise causes remain elusive, but it is theorized that mutations in the DNA of 
normal brain cells contribute to tumor development. These growths exhibit varying rates and 
impact the nervous system based on their location. The project addresses the pressing challenge 
of manual brain tumor diagnosis through the development of an automated system using 
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). In the context of abnormal cell growth in the brain, 
timely detection is paramount. The conventional method, relying on radiologists' meticulous 
analysis of MRI scans, is not only time-intensive but prone to errors. To solve this serious issue 
and leverage the power of CNNs, the project aims to create a robust model capable of classifying 
brain MRI images.
  The dataset known as the "Brain Tumor MRI Dataset" comprises 7023 MRI images of the 
human brain, categorized into four groups: glioma, meningioma, no tumor, and pituitary. Gliomas 
arise from glial cells in the brain and spinal cord, whereas meningiomas are generally benign 
tumors originating from the meninges, the protective layers enveloping the brain and spinal cord. 
Pituitary tumors form in the pituitary gland, impacting hormone regulation.
